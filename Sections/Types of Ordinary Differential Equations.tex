	\textit{There are various types of Ordinary Differential Equations based on the specific values/functions that replace the the values of the coefficients of the differential equation, order and degree of the equation.}	
	
	\subsection{\textit{Linear Ordinary Differential Equations}}

		\textit{Linear Ordinary Differential Equations are differential equations where, the degree/exponent of the differential equation is 1 and the coefficients of the differential equation are some arbitrary differential functions in the base variable.}

	\subsection{\textit{Non-Linear Ordinary Differential Equations}}

		\textit{An Ordinary Differential equation is said to be  non-linear when the degree/exponent of the differential equation is anything but 1 and the co-efficient of the the differential equation is a non-differentiable function of in the principal function, ie. $\sin{y}$ as $a_k$ or $\left(\overset{k}{\dot{y}}\right)^2$ for some value k.}
