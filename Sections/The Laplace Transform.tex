\subsection{\textit{The Laplace Transform}}

	\textit{The Laplace Transform is a integral transform that transforms a function fro the time domain to the complex frequency-domain. The transform is mathematically defined as,}

		$$\mathcal{L}\{f\}(s) = F(s) = \int_0^{\infty}f(t)e^{-st} dt = \int_0^{\infty}f(t)e^{-\sigma t}e^{-iwt} dt$$

	\textit{Where $s = \sigma + iw$. Therefore the transform is defined as,}
	
		$$\mathcal{L}\{f\}(s) = F(s) = \int_0^{\infty}f(t)e^{-\sigma t}e^{-iwt} dt$$
	
	\textit{The Laplace Transform is a linear operator, therefore it is only applicable and can only be applied to linear polynomials and functions, which implies that this transform can be used to compute the solutions of differential equations of any order, provided that they are linear.}
