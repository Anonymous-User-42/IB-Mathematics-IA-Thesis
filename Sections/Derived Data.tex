\textit{We shall be modelling the viscous drag with respect to time for all cases with the aid of the simulation program with the initial utility of equations \ref{eq3} and \ref{eq4}, and shall call it derived data, as it is derived from the values of radial and angular displacement versus time, and this is not the primary focus of this investigation.}

\textit{All data necessary relating to this chapter of the investigation can be found in \textbf{appendix \ref{dvdata}}}
