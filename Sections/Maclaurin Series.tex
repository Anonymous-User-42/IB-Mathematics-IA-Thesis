\subsection{\textit{Maclaurin Series}}

	\textit{The Maclaurin Series of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at 0. The Maclaurin series is mathematically defined as,}

		$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\cdot x^n$$

	\textit{The Maclaurin series aids us to decompose any function directly/indirectly into, an infinite series, which then can be approximated accordingly. The real hidden use could be to decompose a term that obstructs a solution to an ODE, first into a Fourier series and then into a Maclaurin series.}

	\textit{The Maclaurin series of the base trigonometric functions are,}

		$$\sin x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}\cdot x^{2n+1}$$
		
		$$\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!}\cdot x^{2n}$$
