\textit{In this paper, I have answered the question posed at the beginning of the paper. Namely, to find any existent relationship that exists between the Laplace/Fourier Transforms with various infinite series and how can they be optimally utilized to solve ODE's  considering many cases.}

\textit{I have in the due process of this exploration discovered an unique relationship between various transforms, series and the many ways with the aid of mathematical conversion and systematic approach to optimally solve various ODE's in an systematic approach.}
