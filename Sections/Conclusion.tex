%{In this paper, I have answered the question posed at the beginning of the paper. Namely, to find any existent relationship that exists between the Laplace/Fourier Transforms with various infinite series and how can they be optimally utilized to solve ODE's  considering many cases.}

%{I have in the due process of this exploration discovered an unique relationship between various transforms, series and the many ways with the aid of mathematical conversion and systematic approach to optimally solve various ODE's in an systematic approach.}

{A small problem can lead to complicated and often unfathomable notions and solutions, which is the wonder of mathematics. The Brachistochrone curve, which began as a simple task to infer the shortest path between two objects in space aided by gravity, evolved into the Calculus of Variations, an entire field of mathematics.}

{I discovered various Mathematical Association of America research papers through my "basic" investigation, which I discovered while surfing Wikipedia late one night, Articles, lecture notes, books, physics applications.}

{Not only did I get my first taste of the calculus of variations, a field I'd never heard of before.}

{Generally taught at the college level; however, I now understand partial derivatives and how to use them.}

{The branch between analytic calculus and the realm of geometry is known as the parametric equation.
Surprisingly, I discovered my shortcomings in Conventional Mathematics due to this investigation.}
