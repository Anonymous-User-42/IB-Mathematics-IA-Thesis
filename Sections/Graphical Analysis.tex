    \textit{Upon close visual observation, we see that the difference in the plotted values of that of the simulation and experimental values of the radial displacement, angular displacement, angular frequency and absolute frequency from the \textbf{x-t} graph are very minute to the extent that it would be right to say and consider that the experimental values are both accurate and precise in relation to that of the literature/theoretical/simulation values.}
        
    \textit{We also observe that, with increase in mass, the \textbf{amplitude} of the parameters employed in this investigation also increases while the \textbf{frequency} of the parameters employed stays approximately constant.}
