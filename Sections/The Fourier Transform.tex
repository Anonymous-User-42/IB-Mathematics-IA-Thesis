	\textit{The Fourier Transform is also an integral transform that transforms a function from the time domain to the complex frequency-domain. The Fourier transform differs from the Laplace transform because the Fourier transform is a slice of the Laplace transform, a component of the Laplace transform. The transform represents for one single value of the Laplace transform.}

	\textit{The transform is mathematically defined as,}

		$$\mathcal{F}\{f\}(s) = F(s) = \int_0^{\infty}f(t)e^{-iwt} dt$$

	\textit{The Fourier Transform is also a linear operator, therefore it is only applicable and can only be applied to linear polynomials and functions, which implies that this transform can be used to compute the solutions of differential equations of any order, provided that they are linear.}
