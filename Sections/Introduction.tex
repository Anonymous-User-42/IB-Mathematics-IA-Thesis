%\textit{I have chosen this research question because the fundamental relation between the \textbf{Laplace transform} and its effects on the the \textbf{applied function} and its excruciating difficulty in possibly modeling this behavior has led me to explore this field, as this mathematical concept is exciting, unique and wonderful, with ample scope to study and analyze.}


\textit{I have chosen this research question because I intend to study \textbf{Electrical Engineering} and further study \textbf{Mechatronics}. The fundamental concepts of the \textbf{Laplace transform}, \textbf{Fourier transform} and the \textbf{Fourier series} form the \textbf{backbone} of a subfield in Electrical Engineering, that is "\textbf{Signal processing}", without which any sort of \textbf{communication}, through any \textbf{electrical device} would not be possible, which implies that \textbf{modern day computers} and \textbf{computational technology} that exists today would also \textbf{not be existent}.}

\textit{The very idea that all of computational technology depends on the concepts laid out \textbf{150} to \textbf{200 years ago}, deeply interests me, and thus has led me to \textbf{study the complex relationships} within \textbf{various mathematical concepts}.}
