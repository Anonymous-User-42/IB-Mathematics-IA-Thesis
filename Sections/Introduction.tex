\textit{I have chosen this research question because the fundamental relation between the mechanics of the damped elastic pendulum, its complex dynamics, its unstable chaotic behaviour and its excruciating difficulty in possibly modeling this behaviour has led me to explore this field, as this phenomenon is exciting, unique and wonderful, with ample scope to carry out research and collect data both quantitatively and qualitatively.}
