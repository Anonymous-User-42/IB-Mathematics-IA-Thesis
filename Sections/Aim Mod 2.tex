%{To study the various elements of the \textbf{Laplace} and \textbf{Fourier transforms} while also studying the \textbf{Fourier series} from different mathematical aspects so as to answer the statement posed at the beginning of paper, which is \textbf{to find if there exists any relationship} between the \textbf{Laplace transform}, \textbf{Fourier transform} and the \textbf{Fourier series}, if so what is its \textbf{mathematical significance} and how can it be optimally used to solve \textbf{Ordinary Differential Equations}. This paper aims to answer the above questions.}

{To study and explore the mathematics behind this simple mechanics phenomenon from an high-school student perspective.}
