\textit{We will discuss the effects of change in the magnitude of \textbf{mass} on the magnitude of the \textbf{radial position}, \textbf{angular position} and the \textbf{integral frequencies} of the system of the damped elastic harmonic oscillator, by collecting raw data on the measurement of \textbf{radial displacement}, \textbf{angular displacement}, \textbf{angular frequency} and \textbf{absolute frequency} with respect to time under certain controlled spaces with \textbf{defined standard initial conditions}.}
