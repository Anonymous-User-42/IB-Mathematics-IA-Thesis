\textit{We shall discuss the \textbf{Laplace Transform} extensively and the effects it has on functions when its is applied on them, and also on how an fundamental intuitive mathematical idea of \textbf{superposition} gave rise to one of the most important concepts and fields of study in \textbf{calculus}, \textbf{number theory}, \textbf{combinatorics} and how \textbf{information} is \textbf{transferred} and \textbf{processed} globally. We shall also discuss the \textbf{optimal methods} through which the transform can be applied to yield the most \textbf{accurate solutions} of a function.}
