	{An Ordinary Differential Equation in one variable is generally mathematically defined as,}	
		
		$$a_{n}\bigg(\overset{n}{\dot{y}}\bigg)^p + a_{n-1}\bigg(\overset{n-1}{\dot{y}}\bigg)^q + a_{n-2}\bigg(\overset{n-2}{\dot{y}}\bigg)^r + \cdots + a_{2}\bigg(\ddot{y}\bigg)^e + a_{1}\bigg(\dot{y}\bigg)^f + a_{0}\bigg(y\bigg)^g = c$

	{Where y is a function of a base variable, ie. x and $\overset{n}{\dot{y}}$ is the nth derivative of y, the principal function.}

	{Or in alternate matrix representation, this can be expressed as,}

		$$\begin{bmatrix}
		a_{n} & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0\\
		0 & a_{n-1} & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & a_{n-2} & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0\\
		\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & 0 & 0 & 0\\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & a_{2} & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & a_{1} & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & a_{0} \\
		\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
		\bigg(\overset{n}{\dot{y}}\bigg)^p \\
		\bigg(\overset{n-1}{\dot{y}}\bigg)^q \\
		\bigg(\overset{n-2}{\dot{y}}\bigg)^r \\
		\vdots \\
		\Big({\ddot{y}}\Big)^e \\
		\Big({\dot{y}}\Big)^f \\
		\Big(y\Big)^g \\
		\end{bmatrix} = c$$

	{Where n is the order of the differential equation, $a_{n}$, $a_{n-1}$, $a_{n-2} \cdots$ are some arbitrary constants known as the coefficients of the differential equation and p, q, r $\cdots$ are also some arbitrary constants, of which the highest constant in value is the degree of the differential equation. It is these constants/functions differentiate differential equation with other forms of the differential equations. c is a fixed constant in the equation, usually zero. In theory these constants can be any function or a constant, but for every type of function that takes place, the values of p, q , r , etc. create some additional segregation and constraints in solving the differential equation.}
